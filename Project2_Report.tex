\section*{Introduction}

In this project, I will be using given transmission signals ($x_{TX}(t))$, received signals(\(x_{RX}(t)\)), and a desired audio waveform (\(x_a(t)\))  
to find a low-pass filter, such that the audio waveform \(x_a(t)\) can be output cleanly after transmission.

\section*{Part I(a): Derivation for the Transmitter}

Given a signal with a frequency of 500 Hz, \\ 
\begin{equation*}
    x(t) = \text{cos}(2\pi \times 500t)
\end{equation*}
and an arbitrary carrier frequency (\(F_c\)), to which the carrier signal is
\begin{equation*}
    x_c(t) = \text{cos}(2\pi F_ct)
\end{equation*}

\subsection*{Calculation 1: \(x_{TX}(t)\) as a Sum of Cosines}

\begin{equation*}
x_{TX}(t) = x(t)x_c(t)
\end{equation*}

Using the known signals, \(x(t)\) and \(x_c(t)\), we can substitute these functions into \(x_{TX}(t)\).

\[x_{TX}(t) = (\text{cos}(2\pi \times 500t))(\text{cos}(2\pi F_ct))\]

Using the trigonometric identity
\begin{equation*} 
\text{cos}(u)\text{cos}(v) = \dfrac{1}{2}[\text{cos}(u+v)+\text{cos}(u-v)]
\end{equation*}

Substituting in $x(t)$ for the cos(u) term, and $x_c(t)$ for the cos(v) term,

   \[\text{cos}(2\pi \times 500)\text{cos}(2\pi F_ct) = \dfrac{1}{2}[\text{cos}(2\pi \times 500t + 2\pi F_ct) + \text{cos}(2\pi \times 500t - 2\pi F_ct)]\]


Resulting in the equation

\begin{equation*}   
x_{TX}(t) = \dfrac{1}{2}\Bigl[\text{cos}(2\pi \times 500t + 2\pi F_ct) + \text{cos}(2\pi \times 500t - 2\pi F_ct)\Bigr]
\end{equation*}

Then distributing the \(1/2\) to each cosine

\[x_{TX}(t) = \dfrac{1}{2}\text{cos}(2\pi \times 500t + 2\pi F_ct) + \dfrac{1}{2}\text{cos}(2\pi \times 500t - 2\pi F_ct)\]

and factoring out \(2\pi\) from each cosine term

\[x_{TX}(t) = \dfrac{1}{2}\text{cos}(2\pi(500t + F_ct)) + \dfrac{1}{2}\text{cos}(2\pi(500t - F_ct))\]

And finally, factoring out t from each term.

  \[ x_{TX}(t) = \dfrac{1}{2}\text{cos}(2\pi t(500 + F_c)) + \dfrac{1}{2}\text{cos}(2\pi t(500 - F_c)) \]


\clearpage

\subsection*{Calculation 1 Results:}

As shown through using trigonometic identities, and basic algebraic techniques, \(x_{TX}(t)\) can be expressed as a sum of cosines as follows.

\begin{equation*}
   \boxed{x_{TX}(t) = \dfrac{1}{2}\text{cos}(2\pi t(500 + F_c)) + \dfrac{1}{2}\text{cos}(2\pi t(500 - F_c)) }
\end{equation*}


\subsection*{Calculation 2: The Fourier Transform of \(x_{TX}(t)\)}

The Fourier Transform for a continuous signal is defined as

\begin{equation*}   
    X(F) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) e^{-j2\pi Ft}dt
\end{equation*}

Thankfully, the function \(x_{TX}(t)\) has a known Fourier Transform pair. The known pairing is

\begin{equation*}
    x(t) = \text{cos}(2\pi F_0t) \xleftrightarrow{\quad \mathcal{F} \quad}X(F) = \dfrac{1}{2}[\delta(F - F_0) + \delta(F +F_0)]
\end{equation*}
\newline
Since a property of the Fourier Transform is linearity, this means that we can split the function,

\[x_{TX}(t) = \dfrac{1}{2}\text{cos}(2\pi t(500 + F_c)) + \dfrac{1}{2}\text{cos}(2\pi t(500 - F_c))\]
into two parts and apply the transform to each part. The first cosine term is
\begin{equation*}
\dfrac{1}{2}\text{cos}(2\pi t(500 + F_c)) \xleftrightarrow{\quad \mathcal{F} \quad} \dfrac{1}{2} \left[\dfrac{1}{2}[\delta(F - 500+F_c) + \delta(F +500+F_c)]\right]
\end{equation*}
\[= \dfrac{1}{4} \Bigl[ \delta (F - 500 +F_c) + \delta (F + 500 + F_c)\Bigr]\]
\[= \dfrac{1}{4} \delta (F - 500 + F_c) + \dfrac{1}{4} \delta (F + 500 + F_c)\]

Then the second cosine term,

\begin{equation*}
\dfrac{1}{2}\text{cos}(2\pi t(500 - F_c)) \xleftrightarrow{\quad \mathcal{F} \quad} \dfrac{1}{2} \left[\dfrac{1}{2}[\delta(F - 500-F_c) + \delta(F +500-F_c)]\right]
\end{equation*}
\[= \dfrac{1}{4} \Bigl[ \delta (F - 500 - F_c) + \delta (F + 500 - F_c)\Bigr]\]
\[= \dfrac{1}{4} \delta (F - 500 - F_c) + \dfrac{1}{4} \delta (F + 500 - F_c)\]

Then, referencing back to the linearity property, we are able to add these two transformed terms back together to have the final Fourier Transform, \(X_{TX}(F)\).

\[X_{TX}(F) =\dfrac{1}{4} \delta (F - 500 + F_c) + \dfrac{1}{4} \delta (F + 500 + F_c) + \dfrac{1}{4} \delta (F - 500 - F_c) + \dfrac{1}{4} \delta (F + 500 - F_c)\]

Finally, we can factor out the \(1/4\) term from each cosine, giving us our final answer.

\begin{equation*}
    \boxed{X_{TX}(F) =\dfrac{1}{4} \left[ \delta (F - 500 + F_c) + \delta (F + 500 + F_c) + \delta (F - 500 - F_c) + \delta (F + 500 - F_c) \right]}
\end{equation*}


\subsection*{Calculation 3:}

It is important to verify that the pairs and properties of the Fourier Transform were applied properly. In order to do this, the Fourier Transforms of both \(x(t)\) and \(x_{c}(t)\)
will be performed. Beginning with \(x_t(t)\), we can note that the signal can be used with the same pair used in finding the Fourier Transform of \(X_{TX}(F)\) being,


    \[x(t) = \text{cos}(2\pi F_0t) \xleftrightarrow{\quad \mathcal{F} \quad}X(F) = \dfrac{1}{2}[\delta(F - F_0) + \delta(F +F_0)]\]

Substituting in our \(x(t)\) gives
\[x(t) = \text{cos}(2\pi \times 500t) \xleftrightarrow{\quad \mathcal{F} \quad}X(F) = \dfrac{1}{2}[\delta(F - 500) + \delta(F +500)]\]
\[x(t) = \text{cos}(2\pi \times 500t) \xleftrightarrow{\quad \mathcal{F} \quad}X(F) = \dfrac{1}{2}\delta(F - 500) + \dfrac{1}{2}\delta(F +500)\]
and doing the same for \(x_c(t)\)
\[x_c(t) = \text{cos}(2\pi F_ct) \xleftrightarrow{\quad \mathcal{F} \quad}X_c(F) = \dfrac{1}{2}[\delta(F - Fc) + \delta(F + Fc)]\]
\[x_c(t) = \text{cos}(2\pi F_ct) \xleftrightarrow{\quad \mathcal{F} \quad}X_c(F) = \dfrac{1}{2}\delta(F - Fc) + \dfrac{1}{2}\delta(F + Fc)\]

This results in our final calculations for \(X(F)\) and \(X_c(F)\) to be 
\[\boxed{X(F) = \dfrac{1}{2}\delta(F - 500) + \dfrac{1}{2}\delta(F +500)}\]
\[\boxed{X_c(F) = \dfrac{1}{2}\delta(F - Fc) + \dfrac{1}{2}\delta(F + Fc)}\]

\clearpage

\subsection*{Calculation 4:}
With these two Fourier Transforms, and the multiplication property,
\[x(t)y(t) \xleftrightarrow{\quad \mathcal{F} \quad} X(F) \ast Y(F) \]
we can define the Fourier Transform of \(x_{TX}(t)\) as
\[X_{TX}(F) = X(F) \ast X_C(F)\]

Substituing the values found above for \(X(F)\) and \(X_c(F)\), we have the new function
\[X_{TX}(F) = \dfrac{1}{2}\delta(F - 500) + \dfrac{1}{2}\delta(F +500) \ast \dfrac{1}{2}\delta(F - Fc) + \dfrac{1}{2}\delta(F + Fc) \]

To simplify the terms of this \(X_{TX}(F)\), the function must be convolved. To do this, the shifting and linearity properties of convolution must be applied.
\[x(t) \ast \delta(t - t_0) = x(t - t_0)\]

For ease of viewing, each term in the convolution has been labeled as follows

\begin{equation*}
    X_{TX}(F) = \overset{\circled{1}}{ {\frac{1}{2}\delta(F - 500)} } 
              + \overset{\circled{2}}{ {\frac{1}{2}\delta(F + 500)} } 
              \ast \overset{\circled{3}}{ {\frac{1}{2}\delta(F - F_c)} } 
              + \overset{\circled{4}}{ {\frac{1}{2}\delta(F + F_c)} }
\end{equation*}

each term on the right hand side, \circled{3} and \circled{4}, must be applied to each term on the left hand side, \circled{1} and \circled{2}.

\[\overset{\circled{1}}{ {\frac{1}{2}\delta(F - 500)}} \ast \overset{\circled{3}}{ {\frac{1}{2}\delta(F - F_c)} }  = \dfrac{1}{4} \delta(F - 500 - F_C)\]
\[\overset{\circled{1}}{ {\frac{1}{2}\delta(F - 500)} } \ast \overset{\circled{4}}{ {\frac{1}{2}\delta(F + F_c)} } = \dfrac{1}{4} \delta(F - 500 + F_C)\]
\[\overset{\circled{2}}{ {\frac{1}{2}\delta(F + 500)} }  \ast\overset{\circled{3}}{ {\frac{1}{2}\delta(F - F_c)} } = \dfrac{1}{4} \delta(F + 500 - F_C)\]
\[\overset{\circled{2}}{ {\frac{1}{2}\delta(F + 500)} }  \ast \overset{\circled{4}}{ {\frac{1}{2}\delta(F + F_c)} } = \dfrac{1}{4} \delta(F + 500 + F_C)\]



Then, referencing back to the linearity property, we are able to add these terms back together to have the final Fourier Transform, \(X_{TX}(F)\).

\[X_{TX}(F) =\dfrac{1}{4} \delta (F - 500 + F_c) + \dfrac{1}{4} \delta (F + 500 + F_c) + \dfrac{1}{4} \delta (F - 500 - F_c) + \dfrac{1}{4} \delta (F + 500 - F_c)\]

And we can factor out the \(1/4\) term from each cosine, giving us our final answer.

\begin{equation*}
    \boxed{X_{TX}(F) =\dfrac{1}{4} \left[ \delta (F - 500 + F_c) + \delta (F + 500 + F_c) + \delta (F - 500 - F_c) + \delta (F + 500 - F_c) \right]}
\end{equation*}

\clearpage

Comparing this to the \(X_{TX}(F)\) found in \textbf{Calculation 2}, we can see that both of these ways result in the same answer, verifying the linearity and convolution properties of the
Fourier Transform. 

\subsection*{Question 1: How is \(X_{TX}(F)\) related to \(X(F)\)?}

Let's begin by looking at a graph of \(X(F)\).
\begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Question1_XF.png}  
    \end{figure}

Above we can see two stems, located at -500 and +500, with a height of 1/2. With the signal being centered around 0. Now let us look at a graph for \(X_{TX}(F)\), with an \(F_c\) of 0.
\begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Q1_FC0.png}  
    \end{figure}

    We can see that this is the same graph. Looking at a graph where \(F_c = 5500\), we can see a change in the graph. 

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Q1_FC5500.png}  
    \end{figure}

    Looking at this graph, we can see that when the signal is shifted by $F_c$, it is bound by \(X(F)\). This tells us that \textbf{the relation between \(X_{TX}(F)\) and $X(F)$ is that $X(F)$ bounds
    $X_{TX}(F)$ into 500 Hz frequency bands, which are then shifted by $F_c$.}\\
    

    Now, should we have been given an audio waveform \(x_a(t)\), given only the knowledge that it has a Fourier transform \(X_a(F)\) which only has non-zero values for \(\left|F\right| < 22\)kHz
    and it is a real signal, meaning that it is conjugate symmetric.\\

    We shall now redefine our transmission signal by
    \[x_{TX}(t) = x_a(t)x_c(t)\]

    \subsection*{Calculation 5: \(X_{TX}(F)\) in terms of \(X_a(F)\)}
    Despite not knowing the signal \(x_a(t)\), we will still take the Fourier transform to find our new, transformed signal, \(X_{TX}(F)\). For now, we will define the Fourier transform of \(x_a(t)\) as \(X_a(F)\).
    \[x_{TX}(t) = x_a(t)x_c(t) \xleftrightarrow{\quad \mathcal{F} \quad} X_{TX}(F) = X_a(F)\ast X_c(F)\]
    Since we have previously defined \(X_c(F)\), we can easily substitute it in.
    \[X_{TX}(F) = X_a(F) \ast \Bigl(\dfrac{1}{2}\delta(F - Fc) + \dfrac{1}{2}\delta(F + Fc)\Bigr)\]
    Now, using the shifting property of convolution, \(x(t) \ast \delta(t-t_0) = x(t-t_0)\).

    \[\boxed{X_{TX}(F) = \dfrac{1}{2}X_a(F-F_c) + \dfrac{1}{2}X_a(F+F_c)}\]

    \subsection*{Question 2: How is \(X_{TX}(F)\) related to \(X_a(F)\)?}

    Based on the above definition of \(X_{TX}(F)\) we can determine that \textbf{\(X_{TX}(F)\) is two scaled and shifted \(X_a(F)\) signals. }
    \text

    \subsection*{Question 3: What is the bandwidth of \(X_a(F)\) if we only consider the positive side of the F-Axis?}
    With the hypothetical that the minimum frequency of \(X_a(F)\) is F = 0 Hz, and the maximum frequency is F = 22kHz, the bandwith is the difference between the largest and smallest frequency.
    The difference between the two frequencies, 0 Hz and 22k Hz, is 22k Hz. With that
    we can say that \textbf{the bandwidth of \(X_a(F)\) is 22k Hz}

    \subsection*{Question 4: What is the bandwidth of \(X_{TX}(F)\) if we only consider the positive side of the F-Axis?}

    Based on the definition of \(X_{TX}(F)\),

    \[X_{TX}(F) = \dfrac{1}{2}X_a(F-F_c) + \dfrac{1}{2}X_a(F+F_c)\]
    
    This tells us that we have placed \(X_a(F)\) on both the negative and positive side of $F_c$. Due to the bandwidth of \(X_a(F)\) being 22k Hz, we can determine that \(X_{TX}(F)\) will
    span from \(F_c -22\)k Hz to \(F_c+22\)k Hz. The difference between \(F_c -22\)k Hz and \(F_c+22\)k Hz is 44k Hz, so \textbf{the bandwidth of \(X_{TX}(F)\) is 44k Hz}
     \subsection*{Question 5: How does the bandwidth of \(X_{TX}(F)\) compare with the bandwidth of \(X_a(F)\)}

    With the bandwidth of \(X_{TX}(F)\) being 44k Hz, and the bandwidth of \(X_a(F)\) being 22k Hz, we can deduce that \textbf{the bandwidth of \(X_{TX}(F)\) is twice that of \(X_a(F)\)}.

\clearpage
    \section*{Part I(b): Derivation for the Receiver}

    A received signal, \(x_{RX}(t)\) is defined as
    \[x_{RX}(t) = x_{TX}(t) + x_I(t)\]
where \(x_I(t)\) denotes interfering signals. We know nothing about \(x_I(t)\) other than it has a Fourier transform, \(X_I(F)\), and \(X_I(F)\) = 0 for all values of F where \(X_{TX}(F)\)
is non-zero. (out-of-band interferers.)

\subsection*{Calculation 6: Write an expression for the Fourier transform \(X_{RX}(F)\) in terms of \(X_{TX}(F)\) and \(X_I(F)\)}

\[x_{RX}(t) = x_{TX}(t) + x_I(t) \xleftrightarrow{\quad \mathcal{F}\quad} \boxed{X_{RX}(F) = X_{TX}(F) + X_I(F)}\]

\subsection*{Calculation 7: Next, replace the expression for \(X_{TX}(F)\) with its expression in terms of \(X_a(F)\)}
\(X_{TX}(F)\) is defined as
\[X_{TX}(F) = \dfrac{1}{2}X_a(F-F_c) + \dfrac{1}{2}X_a(F+F_c)\]
now substituing this into the equation for \(X_{RX}(F)\)
\[\boxed{X_{RX}(F) = \dfrac{1}{2}X_a(F-F_c) + \dfrac{1}{2}X_a(F+F_c) + X_I(F)}\]



\subsection*{Calculation 8: The Fourier Transform of \(x_d(t)\)}
Now, the signal \(x_{RX}(t)\) is down-converted from the carrier frequency (\(F_c\)) to the audio frequency by multiplying it by \(x_c(t)\). Let \(x_d(t)\) be the down-converted signal, given by
\[x_d(t) = x_{RX}(t)x_c(t)\]

Using the multiplication property of the Fourier transform, 

 \[x(t)y(t) \xleftrightarrow{\quad \mathcal{F} \quad} X(F)\ast Y(F)\]
 We can define \(X_d(F)\) as

 \[X_d(F) = X_{RX}(F) \ast X_c(F)\]

 \(X_{RX}(F)\) is defined as

\[X_{RX}(F) = \dfrac{1}{2}X_a(F-F_c) + \dfrac{1}{2}X_a(F+F_c) + X_I(F)\]

Allowing us to substitute into the equation for \(X_d(F)\)

\[X_d(F) = \left[\dfrac{1}{2}X_a(F-F_c) + \dfrac{1}{2}X_a(F+F_c) + X_I(F) \right]\ast X_c(F)\]

and \(X_c(F)\) is defined as
\[X_c(F) = \dfrac{1}{2}\delta(F - Fc) + \dfrac{1}{2}\delta(F + Fc)\]

Allowing another substitution.

\[X_d(F) = \left[\dfrac{1}{2}X_a(F-F_c) + \dfrac{1}{2}X_a(F+F_c) + X_I(F) \right]\ast \left[\dfrac{1}{2}\delta(F - Fc) + \dfrac{1}{2}\delta(F + Fc)\right]\]

Using the shifting property of convolution,

\[X_d(F) = \dfrac{1}{4}X_a(F - F_c - F_c) + \dfrac{1}{4}X_a(F + F_c - F_c) + \dfrac{1}{2}X_I(F - F_c) + \dfrac{1}{4}X_a(F - F_c + F_c) + \dfrac{1}{4}X_a(F + F_c + F_c) + \dfrac{1}{2}X_I(F+F_c)\]

Simplifying this gives

\[X_d(F) = \dfrac{1}{4}X_a(F-2F_c) + \dfrac{1}{4}X_a(F) + \dfrac{1}{2}X_I(F-F_c) + \dfrac{1}{4}X_a(F) + \dfrac{1}{4}X_a(F+2F_c) + \dfrac{1}{2}X_I(F+F_c)\]

Further simplifying and rearranging terms,

\[\boxed{X_d(F) = \dfrac{1}{4}X_a(F-2F_c) + \dfrac{1}{4}X_a(F+2F_c) + \dfrac{1}{2}X_a(F) + \dfrac{1}{2}X_I(F+F_c) + \dfrac{1}{2}X_I(F-F_c)}\]

Our final answer, and expression for \(X_d(F)\).

\subsection*{Calculation 9: The Inverse Fourier Transform of \(X_d(F)\)}

Using the Fourier pairing

\[x(t) = \text{cos}(2\pi F_0 t) \xleftrightarrow{\quad \mathcal{F} \quad} X(F) = \dfrac{1}{2}\left[ \delta (F-F_0) + \delta (F+F_0)\right]\]

we are able to simplify the \(X_a(F \pm 2F_c)\) and \(X_I(F \pm F_c)\) terms. Firstly, the \(X_a(F)\) terms.

\[\dfrac{1}{4}X_a(F - 2F_c) + \dfrac{1}{4}X_a(F + 2F_c)\]
\[\dfrac{1}{4} \Bigl[X_a(F - 2F_c) + X_a(F + 2F_c)  \Bigr] \]
\[\dfrac{1}{2}\biggl[ \dfrac{1}{2} \Bigl[X_a(F - 2F_c) + X_a(F + 2F_c)  \Bigr] \biggr]\]
\[\dfrac{1}{2}\biggl[ \dfrac{1}{2} \Bigl[X_a(F - 2F_c) + X_a(F + 2F_c)  \Bigr] \biggr]\xrightarrow{\quad \mathcal{F}^{-1} \quad} \dfrac{1}{2}x_a(t)\text{cos}(2\pi(2F_c)t)\]
\[X_a(F \pm 2F_c) \xrightarrow{\mathcal{F}^{-1}}\dfrac{1}{2}x_a(t)\text{cos}(4\pi F_ct)\]


Now, the \(X_I(F \pm F_c)\) terms.
\[\dfrac{1}{2}X_I(F + F_c) + \dfrac{1}{2}X_I(F - F_c)\]
\[\dfrac{1}{2} \Bigl[ X_I(F + F_c) + X_I(F - F_c) \Bigr]\]
\[\dfrac{1}{2} \Bigl[ X_I(F + F_c) + X_I(F - F_c) \Bigr] \xrightarrow{\quad \mathcal{F}^{-1} \quad} x_I(t)\text{cos}(2\pi F_ct)\]
\[X_I(F \pm F_0) \xrightarrow{\mathcal{F}^{-1}} x_I(t)\text{cos}(2\pi F_ct)\]

The final transform which has no shifts, is simple enough

\[\dfrac{1}{2}X_a(F) \xrightarrow{\mathcal{F}^{-1}} \dfrac{1}{2}x_a(t)\]

Now, with the pieces that we have found, we can reconstruct the signal using the linearity property of the Fourier transform.

\[\boxed{x_d(t) = \dfrac{1}{2}x_a(t) + \dfrac{1}{2}x_a(t)\text{cos}(4\pi F_c t) + x_I(t)\text{cos}(2\pi F_c t)}\]

\subsection*{Calculation 10: The Fourier transform for the ideal filter \(H(F)\)}
To fully recieve our signal, we must now apply a filter to remove the unwanted content, so we are only left with \(x_a(t)\). Knowing that our transformed signal, \(X_a(F)\) does not
have content above \(F = 22\)kHz. The ideal low pass filter is a rect function, centered at \(F = 0\)Hz, with a width of \(2F_{LPF}\) (Low-Pass Filter), where \(F_{LPF}\) is the cutoff
frequency of the filter. In our case, \(F_{LPF} = 22\)kHz

Knowing that we are centered at F = 0, and have the width of 2\(F_{LPF}\), with the known value of \(F_{LPF}\) = 22kHz we can derive the piecewise function for the shape we want.

\begin{equation*}
    H(F) =
\begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } |F|\le 22\text{ kHz}\\
    0 & \text{if } |F|> 22\text{ kHz}\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}


This works because if F is in the range  \(-22\text{ kHz} \le F \le 22\text{ Hz} \), we will allow the signal through, but if we are outside the range, \(F > 22\text{ kHz}\) or \(F < -22 \text{ kHz}\)
nothing will pass through.

Using the piecewise function we created for H(F), we can define H(F) formally as

\[\boxed{H(F) = \text{rect}\Bigl(\dfrac{F}{44\text{ kHz}}\Bigr)}\]

\subsection*{Calculation 11: Determine the Impulse Response h(t)}

The rect function has a known Fourier pairing,
\[X(F) = \text{rect}\Bigl(\dfrac{F}{W}\Bigr) \xleftrightarrow{\quad \mathcal{F} \quad } x(t) = W\text{sinc}(Wt)\]

Using our defined H(F)

\[H(F) =\text{rect}\Bigl(\dfrac{F}{44\text{ kHz}}\Bigr) \xleftrightarrow{\quad \mathcal{F} \quad } h(t) = 44\text{k }\text{sinc}(44\text{k }t)\]

Otherwise expressed as,

\[\boxed{h(t) = 44000\text{ sinc}(44000t)}\]

\subsection*{Calculation 12: The Fourier Transform \(X_{out}(F)\)}

\(x_{out}(t)\) is defined as

\[x_{out}(t) = x_d(t) \ast h(t)\]

Making the assumption that \(X_I(F)\) does not overlap in frequency with \(X_a(F)\), we can redefine \(X_d(F)\) as

\[X_d(F) = \dfrac{1}{4}X_a(F)(F-2F_c) + \dfrac{1}{4}X_a(F)(F+2F_c) + \dfrac{1}{2}X_a(F)\]

using the Fourier transform property of convolution,

\[x(t) \ast y(t) \xleftrightarrow{\mathcal{F}^{-1}} X(F)Y(F)\]

We can defined the Fourier transform of \(x_{out}(t)\) as 

\[X_{out}(F) = X_d(F)H(F)\]

With the knowledge that \(X_a(F)\) has a bandwith of 22 kHz, and the piecewise function for \(H(F)\),

\begin{equation*}
    H(F) =
\begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } |F|\le 22\text{ kHz}\\
    0 & \text{if } |F|> 22\text{ kHz}\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}

Firstly, let us visualize H(F)

 \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Calc12_HF.png}  
    \end{figure}

We can see that just like the piecewise function describes, H(F) is a box centered about 0, extending from -22 kHz to 22 kHz. Looking at \(X_d(F)\), we can see the term \(\dfrac{1}{4}X_a(F)(F \pm 2F_c)\).
Ideally, our carrier frequency would be very large. Given that \(x_a(t)\) is an audio waveform, we can look at the United States Frequency Allocations Radio Spectrum and more specifically the lowest frequency "Broadcasting" section.

 \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{US_Radio.png}  
    \end{figure}

The figure above shows that the lowest frequency one can use in the United States to broadcast is 535 kHz. This means that the term \(\dfrac{1}{4}X_a(F)(F \pm 2F_c)\) will be outside of our H(F), and thus be zero.

This leaves one remaining term, and thus the expression for \(X_{out}(F)\),

\[\boxed{X_{out}(F) = \dfrac{1}{2}X_a(F)}\]

\subsection*{Calculation 13: The Final Expression for \(x_{out}(t)\)}

After all that, we are able to perform a simple inverse Fourier transform on \(X_{out}(F)\) as follows,
\[X_{out}(F) = \dfrac{1}{2}X_a(F) \xrightarrow{\mathcal{F}^{-1}} x_{out}(t) = \dfrac{1}{2}x_a(t)\]

\[\boxed{x_{out}(t) = \dfrac{1}{2}x_a(t)}\]

\subsection*{Question 6: Does the plot convey any meaningful information? }
No, this graph shows nothing more than a mix of differing carrier frequencies

\subsection*{Question 7: How long is the signal in seconds?}
Based on the plot above, we can determine that the signal is \textbf{10 seconds} long
